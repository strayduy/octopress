The site you're looking at was generated by a static blog engine named [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/).

### Dynamic vs Static Content

When you visit a blog powered by [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) or [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/), the pages you see are dynamically generated. The content of each post is stored in some backend data store, and at the time of request, the web server fetches that content and renders the page into HTML.

Static sites are different in that they don't construct web pages on the fly. The pages are created ahead of time and stored on the server in an already-rendered state. When you request static content, the server simply sends you a pre-existing file.

### Static Site Generators

Static site generators incorporate a rendering component typical of dynamic web pages, but they construct all of the site's content in one shot. In the case of Jekyll, your posts are retrieved from regular files and converted into formatted HTML pages. Jekyll will take care of linking all your posts together. Once generated, you can then upload your entire site structure to your web host of choice.

The downside of this approach is that users will have a limited ability to interact with your site, since it'll essentially be read-only. They might not be able to do things like sign in or post comments. (At least not directly.)

### Why Go Static

For me, I just wanted a simple blogging solution. I'll happily give up the bells and whistles of fancier blogging engines for the ability to write blog posts offline in an ordinary text editor<!-- vim represent -->.

And as someone who writes code for a living, I'm way more comfortable managing my blog content through a [version control system](http://git-scm.com/) rather than through some graphical admin interface.

### Jekyll, and the Bootstrapping Thereof

Jekyll was the first and only static site generator I've tried, so I can't comment on how it compares to [some](http://ringce.com/hyde) [of the](http://pelican.notmyidea.org/en/2.8/index.html) [others](http://cloudhead.io/toto). What I can tell you is that it has [solid documentation](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki), an [active community](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/pulls), and an easy learning curve.

[Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) is also a handy resource for diving into Jekyll. Their skeleton site structure is a good starting point, and you can customize the look of your blog with one of their [half dozen themes](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/).
